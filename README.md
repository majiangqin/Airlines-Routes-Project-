# Airlines-Routes-Project-

This airlines routes project is a programming assignment from the Coursera course Information Visualization: Programming with D3.js. In this project, we will develop a full-linked view visualization that will allow users to explore where the top 20 airlines with the most routes operate in the world. 


Dataset
Our dataset is a CSV file containing 23041 lines, where each line represents one airplane route. Each route contains information from the airport of origin, destination, and airline. 

Our goal is to use this dataset to answer questions like:
1.	What are the airlines with more routes, and what does the distribution look like? Are there airlines with many more routes than others?
2.	Which regions of the world do these airlines cover?
3.	Does a given airline operate on a regional or intercontinental scale?
